# Example project demonstrating usage of PolarBle SDK 

* Example project demos multiple features found from PolarBleSDK library. To get most out of the example project you shall read the source code. The file `PolarBleSdkManager.swift` contains the interaction between the PolarBleSdk library and the example app. Other files in the example project are not relevant for the PolarBleSDK, those are for building the UI etc. While running the project you shall follow the console output to see results caused by the UI buttons.
